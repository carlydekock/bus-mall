### Reflections and Comments
- Dec 14: The first part of this went well, I was able to get three images rendered to the page. It was difficult to ensure those were three unique images. With a lot of help from Ryan, we were able to get it to work, but it was definitely a stretch trying to figure out how to make it happen.
